# Badges

To gain access to the VinUniversity Makerspace Network, users need to earn access Badges. Badging is how we ensure users have the skills to safely and efficiently use our network of materials, machines and spaces.

Remember that you will need to complete pre-requisite online learning components before you are able to book into an offline Badge Training session.

## Dynamic checklist

There is a checklist that will keep track of your progress on each badge. This way you will know which step you are on and what you need to do next. Complete all three steps to earn a badge.
