Filter the machine database by Makerspace, Material, Processes or Machine Type. View what Badge you require to access each machine, then plan your training schedule to achieve the machine access you need.

Once logged in you can filter the machine list to see only the machines you can use. Machine access is dependent on the acquisition of training Badges. Some machines are bookable, follow the prompts to book a machine if applicable.
